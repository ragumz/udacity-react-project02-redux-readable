# READABLE PROJECT

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where was built a post and comment web app. 
Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. 
Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository was based on Udacity GitHub Readable starters repository at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter and includes the code for the backend API Server uses to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.
